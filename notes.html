                    The class covered formal characterization of design techniques such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, memoization, and greedy algorithms, along with an introduction to computational complexity. This class was taught by Wayne Eberly. Although cited as a strict instructor, this is one of three classes on which I scored outside the range of the grade bounds.

This class was taught by Michael Foley. Known for being late to every class, and from what I recall, even the final exam. However, tests were pretty fun to complete, and assignments gave practical examples of what to expect on examinations.

                    In this class, we learned about functional and logic programming paradigms through Haskell and Prolog respectively. Focus is drawn away from the use of loops to instead focus on the application of recursion and other evaluation methods in order to solve problems. This class was taught by Ben Stephenson. Assignments illustrated core concepts well, and the course content was enthusiastically conveyed through clear lectures.
